    "### Question\n",
    "In which of the following situations will a collaborative filtering system be the most appropriate learning algorithm (compared to linear or logistic regression)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options with Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Artist Hand-Painting Portraits**\n",
    "   - [ ] You're an artist and hand-paint portraits for your clients. Each client gets a different portrait (of themselves) and gives you 1-5 star rating feedback, and each client purchases at most 1 portrait. You'd like to predict what rating your next customer will give you.\n",
    "   **Why not?**\n",
    "   - Each portrait is unique and singular per person; Only one observation per user (no shared features between items)\n",
    "   - No repeated observations from the same user\n",
    "   - No item similarity to leverage (collaborative filtering requires patterns across multiple users/items)\n",
    "   - Better suited for regression on artist skill factors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bookstore Sales Volume Prediction**\n",
    "   - [ ] You manage an online bookstore and have book ratings from many users. You want to predict sales volume as a function of average rating.\n",
    "   **Why not?**\n",
    "   - Predicting aggregate sales is a regression problem on a single feature (average rating)\n",
    "   - Doesn't utilize individual user-item interactions\n",
    "   - No need to find similar users/books\n",
    "   - Simple linear regression would suffice\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Book Recommendations (Correct Answer)**\n",
    "   - [x] You run an online bookstore with user ratings. You want to identify similar books to recommend.\n",
    "   **Why?**\n",
    "   - Has the key components for collaborative filtering:\n",
    "     * Many users rating many items; Many observations and many users (dense interaction matrix)\n",
    "     * Goal is to find patterns/similarities in user preferences\n",
    "     * Can use book features to infer characteristics\n",
    "   - Can leverage both:\n",
    "     * User-user similarity (\"people who liked X also liked Y\")\n",
    "     * Item-item similarity (\"Y book is similar to book X\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Genre-Based Movie Ratings**\n",
    "   - [ ] You subscribe to an online video streaming service, and are not satisfied with their movie suggestions.\n",
    "        You download all your viewing for the last 10 years and rate each item. You assign each item a genre.\n",
    "        Using your ratings and genre assignment, you learn to predict how you will rate new movies based on the genre.\n",
    "   **Why not?**\n",
    "   - We need multiple users to compare/recommend between movies\n",
    "   - This is simply a linear/logistic regression for a single person\n",
    "      - A part of recommenders is to capture the similarities with other users to infer the features of an observation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of Good Collaborative Filtering Problems:\n",
    "1. Many users interacting with many items (dense matrix)\n",
    "2. Items share latent features that can be learned\n",
    "3. No pre-defined item features available (if predefined this is just a linear/logistic regression for many users)\n",
    "4. Goal is personalization/recommendation\n",
    "5. Sufficient observation density (users rate multiple items)"

Movies are in rows, users in columns. Each user has a parameter vector $w^{user}$ and bias. Each movie has a feature vector $x^{movie}$. These vectors are simultaneously learned by using the existing user/movie ratings as training data. One training example is shown above: $\\mathbf{w}^{(1)} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}^{(1)} + b^{(1)} = 4$. It is worth noting that the feature vector $x^{movie}$ must satisfy all the users while the user vector $w^{user}$ must satisfy all the movies.
